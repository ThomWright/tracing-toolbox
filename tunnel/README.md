This crate provides [tracing] infrastructure helpers allowing to transfer tracing events
across API boundary:

- `TracingEventSender` is a tracing [`Subscriber`] that converts tracing events
  into (de)serializable presentation that can be sent elsewhere using a customizable hook.
- `TracingEventReceiver` consumes events produced by a `TracingEventSender` and relays them
  to the tracing infrastructure. It is assumed that the source of events may outlive
  both the lifetime of a particular `TracingEventReceiver` instance, and the lifetime
  of the program encapsulating the receiver. To deal with this, the receiver provides
  the means to persist / restore its state.

Both components are used by the [Tardigrade][`tardigrade`] workflows, in case of which
the API boundary is the WASM clientâ€“host boundary.

- The [`tardigrade`] client library uses `TracingEventSender` to send tracing events
  from a workflow (i.e., a WASM module instance) to the host using a WASM import function.
- [The Tardigrade runtime] uses `TracingEventReceiver` to pass traces from the workflow
  to the host tracing infrastructure.

## Usage

Add this to your `Crate.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
tracing-tunnel = "0.1.0"
```

Note that the 3 pieces of functionality described above are gated behind opt-in features;
consult the crate docs for details.
