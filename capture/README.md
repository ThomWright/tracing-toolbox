**Documentation:**

This crate provides a [tracing] [`Layer`] to capture tracing spans as they occur.
The captured spans can then be used for testing assertions (e.g., "Did a span
with a specific name / target / â€¦ occur? What were its fields? Was the span closed?
How many times the span was entered?" and so on).

## Usage

Add this to your `Crate.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
tracing-capture = "0.1.0"
```

## Alternatives / similar tools

[`tracing-test`] is a lower-level alternative. [`tracing-fluent-assertions`] is more
similar in intended goals, but differs significantly in API design; the assertions
need to be declared before the capture.
